# Meal Planner

## About

### What is it?

It is a meal planner for household weekly meal planning, eating smarter and reducing time or food waste.

### Why I did this?

The most asked question in our house is probably "What should we eat tonight?"
As a member of a mordern over-working family, I should not scrach my head so hard every time I open the fridge door. There are so many things inside, but what to prepare for dinner is still too difficult as a question.
Digging out expired dairy products from the bottom of the fridge, throwing away mushy spinach or rotten bell pepers makes me feel guilty.
We deserve fresh quality (more balanced) food but ordering delivery can be a huge expense if it becomes a daily behaviour.
How can I get more organized, optimize grocery shopping and food preparation time while limiting wastes and enjoying more my life without all kinds of hustles ? That's why I've chosen this project.

### Technically

It is a web application designed and implemented with Python and Javascript, using Django as server side framework and React as client side library.
Since I used bootstrap/react-bootstrap, it can also be used on mobile devices.
